UNIFIED CYBER DEFENSE SAAS PLATFORM (VELVET ASTRO)
==================================================

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
Velvet Astro is a comprehensive Cyber Defense SaaS platform designed to provide organizations with real-time threat monitoring, automated defense mechanisms, and human security training. It combines traditional heuristic detections with advanced machine learning and deception technologies to protect against a wide range of cyber threats.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------
The project follows a modern decoupled architecture:

[Backend]
- Language: Python 3.14
- Framework: FastAPI (Async)
- Database: SQLite (via aiosqlite/SQLAlchemy) - easily swappable for PostgreSQL
- ML Libraries: Scikit-Learn, NumPy
- Security: OAuth2, JWT, Passlib (Argon2), Cryptography

[Frontend]
- Framework: Next.js 15 (React)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Visualization: Recharts, Lucide Icons
- Theme: "Velvet Astro" (Dark Mode/Glassmorphism)

3. CORE FEATURES & MODULES
--------------------------
The platform is built in phases, covering 25 distinct development stages.

A. Core Foundations
- Multi-Tenancy: Complete organization isolation.
- Subscription System: Tiered access (Free, Pro, Enterprise).
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Super Admin, Org Admin, IT Security, Employee.

B. Defense Modules
- Module A (Behavioral Anomaly): Detects deviations from user baselines using Isolation Forests.
- Module B (Device Fingerprinting): Tracks user devices and flags new/suspicious hardware.
- Module C (Risk-Based Auth): dynamic policies (e.g., require MFA for high-risk logins).
- Module D (Kill Chain): Correlates events into attack stages (Recon -> Action).
- Module E (Threat Intel): Integrates external feeds to block known bad IPs/domains.
- Module F (AI Prediction): Forecasts likely future attacks based on current trends.
- Module G (Deception): Deploys "Honey Tokens" and fake assets to trap intruders.
- Module H (Attacker Profiling): Groups incidents into "Personas" (e.g., Script Kiddie vs APT).
- Module I (Playbooks): Automated response scripts (e.g., Block IP, Lock Account).
- Module J (Forensics): Cryptographically immutable logging for evidence preservation.

C. User Interface
- Security Dashboard: Real-time attack feed, health metrics, and forecasts.
- Incident Management: Detailed kill-chain visualization and response controls.
- User Profile: Device management and security settings.

4. HOW IT WORKS (DETECTION ENGINES)
-----------------------------------
The platform employs a "Layered Defense" strategy using 6 parallel engines:

1. Statistical Anomaly: ML models flag events that deviate mathematically from the norm.
2. Heuristics: Rules catch known patterns (e.g., "Impossible Travel" between login locations).
3. Deception: Fake assets trigger alerts with 100% confidence when touched.
4. Fingerprinting: Hashing client attributes to detect session hijacking.
5. Threat Intel: Database lookups against known malicious indicators.
6. Kill Chain: State machine logic that links separate events into a coherent attack story.

5. SETUP & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
Prerequisites: Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+

[Backend Setup]
1. Navigate to `/backend`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install FastAPI/Uvicorn/SQLAlchemy manually if requirements missing).
3. Run Migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
4. Start Server: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
   -> API accessible at http://localhost:8000
   -> Docs at http://localhost:8000/docs

[Frontend Setup]
1. Navigate to `/frontend`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start Server: `npm run dev`
   -> UI accessible at http://localhost:3000

[Admin Access]
To verify the system, create an admin user via script or use default if seeded:
- Username: admin@velvet.net
- Password: admin

6. DEPLOYMENT
-------------
The solution is container-ready. Use `docker-compose up --build` to launch the full stack (Database + Backend + Frontend + Redis) in a production-like environment.
